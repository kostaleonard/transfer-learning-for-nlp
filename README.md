# Transfer Learning for NLP

This repository contains notes and worked examples from "Transfer Learning for
Natural Language Processing" by Paul Azunre.

## Datasets and code

The author's code and links to datasets are available on the book's
[GitHub page](https://github.com/azunre/transfer-learning-for-nlp).
For datasets, go to the relevant Kaggle notebook link, then select the "Data"
tab. You can also run the author's code directly on Kaggle.

## Code style

I will mostly preserve the author's choices for code style to maintain
consistency with the book, even if I might have organized things a little
differently.
